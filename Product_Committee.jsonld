    "comment": "After a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the “Cardano Product Committee Community-driven 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research” proposal, I have voted YES for the following reasons:\n\nThe proposal directly supports Cardano’s governance and product roadmap objectives, fostering transparent, inclusive, and broad-based community participation in long-term visioning and yearly roadmap development.\n\nIt provides a structured, scalable process to gather diverse insights addressing challenges in adoption, developer experience, and governance that are critical for Cardano’s future evolution.\n\nThe funding amount requested is proportionate and well-justified given the scope, complexity, and deliverables involved in conducting extensive workshops and research initiatives across global and regional communities.\n\nThe Product Committee demonstrates a strong track record, expertise, and commitment to accountability, with planned public documentation, open repositories, and reporting which ensures transparency and continuous community feedback.\n\nThis initiative is essential to prevent fragmentation and to maintain Cardano’s competitive edge through well-aligned, community-informed product decision making, extending beyond purely technical development into strategic ecosystem growth and participation.\n\nOverall, the project supports the decentralized principles of Cardano by empowering the community’s voice and fostering sustained roadmap excellence, which aligns with the ecosystem’s constitutional and governance rules."
