    "comment": "I voted YES on the Treasury Withdrawal titled UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration requesting ₳220,914 based on its strategic importance, developer adoption, constitutional compliance, and cost effectiveness.\n\nUTxO RPC provides crucial infrastructure for standardizing access to Cardano’s UTxO model using modern RPC endpoints, SDKs, and a shared schema language. This removes major onboarding and integration hurdles for both developers already building on Cardano (e.g. Lace, Mesh, Amaru) and those new to the ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal is well-scoped (0.625 FTEs) and continues TxPipe’s stewardship of one of the most pivotal light-client/public-access gateways in the Rust tooling landscape.\n\nI also confirm administrative compliance and financial oversight using constitutional smart contract infrastructure (TRSC/PSSC), audited by trusted third parties (MLabs, Sundae Labs, TxPipe). All milestones are contract-governed, metadata-linked, and transparently enforced. This is especially fitting given that TxPipe itself contributed to auditing the underlying multi-signature framework.\n\nUTxO RPC is a powerful ecosystem enabler and demonstrates the “invisible infrastructure” layer that modern blockchain platforms must deliver. I support this proposal as a constitutional Treasury action and recommend approval."
