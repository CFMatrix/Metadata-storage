    "comment": "I recommend a YES vote for the ₳592,780 treasury withdrawal for \"Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving.\" This proposal addresses a fundamental gap in the Cardano ecosystem by enabling continuous, transparent, and community-validated governance measurement and improvement.\n\nThe delivery team, led by IOG’s Voltaire specialists with backing from constitutional committee members, WADA, Intersect, and community partners, brings unparalleled experience in Cardano’s governance mechanics and stakeholder engagement. The project will create the first systematic, data-driven “State of Governance” report, track and publish governance KPIs, synthesize community feedback through multiple engagement pathways, author actionable CIPs/CPSs, and publish a replicable playbook for future improvement cycles.\n\nThe budget is reasonable for the scope, the delivery controls are strong, and the outputs will benefit DReps, committees, protocol maintainers, and ordinary users. The framework and open process will raise the standard of Cardano governance by providing a clear baseline, methodology, and improvement pathway, promoting greater transparency and resilience in decentralized decision-making."
