    "comment": "I am voting NO on this proposal to fund \"High-yield RWA Asset for Cardano Tokenized Real Estate\" with ₳3,000,000.\n\nThe proposal presents an exciting vision: onboarding a tested, tokenized US home equity protocol and a real estate-backed token (HausCoin) onto Cardano. However, this experiment comes at a high cost with many unresolved questions. The approach faces significant US/EU regulatory headwinds, must prove legal clarity for tokenized home equity, and lacks immediate, demonstrable ecosystem benefit. The business case is compelling but primarily future-focused, and Cardano’s treasury would assume extensive technical, regulatory, and adoption risk that should be managed and validated incrementally instead.\n\nWhile I support real-world asset innovation, more risk-managed, modular, and transparent approaches are warranted before deploying treasury-scale funding for high-risk, long-horizon ventures. For these reasons, I cannot support the proposal as written."
