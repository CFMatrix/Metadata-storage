For the first time in history, 'We, the people' have access to the infrastructure, tools, resources, manpower, ideas and expertise required to redesign and rebuild the programs and services required for a fully functioning and corruption free existence.\n\nI believe that it is the responsibility of every community member to actively participate in governance and I look forward to the multitude of opinions and views that that will one day fuel the evolution of Cardano, its ecosystem and humanity.\n\nHowever, I understand that there are many who may currently feel that they lack either the technical expertise or adequate time (or both) to properly research and weigh in on every governance proposal submitted so, until we are able to achieve community-wide participation in governance, DReps will be necessary for the facilitation of governance representation."
