    "comment": "I vote YES on this treasury withdrawal request for ₳11,070,323 supporting TWEAG’s multiple core budget projects for Cardano in 2025. \n\nThis suite of initiatives represents a comprehensive and strategically critical investment in Cardano’s foundational infrastructure—ranging from ledger state management, conformance testing, synchronization improvements, to tooling and node emulator development.\n\nTWEAG by Modus Create brings deep domain expertise and a proven track record with Cardano’s core protocol and ecosystem. The proposal outlines robust administrative oversight via milestone-driven legal contracts, third-party assurance, and on-chain metadata transparency executed under a treasury management system. The requested budget aligns realistically with the broad and impactful scope of work. The anticipated benefits include enhanced protocol reliability, improved developer and operator workflows, faster network upgrades, and better overall ecosystem resilience.\n\nApproval of this proposal supports critical foundational improvements essential for Cardano’s scalability, security, and long-term sustainability."
