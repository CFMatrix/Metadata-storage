    "comment": "I voted YES on the Treasury Withdrawal proposal titled zkFold – ZK Rollup for Cardano (₳1,161,000), as it directly advances critical scalability goals for the Cardano protocol using state-of-the-art ZK cryptography.\n\nzkFold proposes a fully general-purpose rollup that helps move dozens to hundreds of dApp interactions off-chain per transaction. This can unlock performance benefits that rival Layer 1 alternatives, while preserving the security guarantees of Cardano.\n\nzkFold’s prototype validates that such execution fits within Cardano’s current Execution Unit limits—showing feasibility today, not years from now.\n\nThe vendor has provided well-defined roles, cryptographic infrastructure knowledge, and a realistic path to testnet. All disbursements are protected via audited smart contracts, milestone validation and delegated to the auto-abstain DRep. Governance is clear, secure, and reversible if milestones aren’t met.\n\nI fully support this as a strategic, constitutionally compliant Infrastructure proposal, aligned explicitly with Cardano’s Basho-era scalability and ecosystem expansion goals."
