    "comment": "I vote YES on the ₳243,478 treasury withdrawal for MLabs’ ongoing maintenance and enhancement of the Plutarch smart contract eDSL. \n\nPlutarch serves a foundational role in the Cardano ecosystem as a trusted, production-ready Haskell-based tool for writing secure, efficient smart contracts. This maintenance-focused proposal responds directly to the need for sustained investment in Cardano core tooling — including patching, updates for hard forks, feature improvements, and user-requested enhancements.\n\nThe vendor has a strong stewardship record for Plutarch and related infrastructures. The proposal is structured around milestone and metadata-based delivery, subject to third-party assurance, with funding routed through open, on-chain governance tooling. This proposal offers a high return in developer productivity, tooling quality, and protocol readiness relative to the cost and fits within the 2025 budget plan. \n\nMaintaining Plutarch improves long-term resilience and helps retain developers within the ecosystem."
