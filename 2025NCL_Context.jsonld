    "comment": "While I understand that setting a Net Change Limit does not mean it is necessary to spend the maximum amount specified by that limit, I have, however, seen this exact scenario play out repeatedly over the years. A higher potential for covering expenses, inevitably leads to higher expenses. Also, I feel it would be irresponsible to to set the 2025 NCL to the entire projected yearly treasury income.  \n\nIt is for these reasons that I am voting NO to this proposal. I feel that a 350M NCL is excessive and is not beholden to a fiscally responsible approach and would incentivize unnecessary and unneeded spending."
