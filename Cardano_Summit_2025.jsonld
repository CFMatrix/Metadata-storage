    "comment": "I vote YES on this proposal to fund the Cardano Summit 2025 and associated regional tech events.\n\nThe Cardano Summit series has long been a cornerstone in the ecosystem, serving as a critical platform where developers, community members, enterprises, regulators, and other stakeholders converge to share knowledge, foster collaboration, and accelerate Cardano’s adoption globally. The 2025 proposal builds on this legacy with a hybrid model: one flagship global summit in Europe alongside four regionally focused events—in the US, Africa, LATAM, and Asia—to expand reach and enhance local engagement.\n\nThis initiative directly supports several of Cardano’s 2025 roadmap priorities: driving developer onboarding through targeted Dev Days and hackathons; showcasing real-world applications; strengthening community and governance dialogue; and attracting capital, talent, and media attention.\n\nI appreciate the strong consortium of co-host partners bringing deep regional expertise and proven event management capabilities. The plan’s clear KPIs for attendance, speakers, and sessions provide measurable milestones for success. I also welcome the ongoing efforts to establish a dedicated Summit Steering Committee and evolving financial models aimed at growing sustainability over time.\n\nHowever, I have some questions and concerns that must be addressed as the initiative progresses:\n\nClarification is needed on the ownership and governance relationship between the Cardano Foundation and the broader ecosystem with respect to these events, including intellectual property, trademarks, and contractual responsibilities.\n\nThe average attendance figures, while meaningful, may not fully capture the Summit’s ecosystem impact; more granular KPIs reflecting post-event developer engagement, ecosystem contribution, and project growth would strengthen accountability.\n\nI further seek transparency on detailed cost breakdowns for each event and how treasury funds translate directly into ecosystem expansion beyond event execution.\n\nCommunity participation and inclusivity should be prioritized to ensure these remain accessible public goods, allowing broad ecosystem representation without pay-to-play barriers.\n\nAdditionally, I acknowledge some DReps voice concerns about the combined funding of flagship and regional events as a single proposal, the scale relative to alternative outreach approaches, and the shift of funding responsibility from founding entities to the treasury.\n\nIn summary, I support this funding request as a necessary strategic investment in Cardano’s global growth and ecosystem development, recognizing the Summit’s unique role as an onboarding and collaboration hub. Simultaneously, I emphasize the need for ongoing transparency, community involvement, and clear demonstration of the value these events deliver to maximize treasury efficiency and long-term ecosystem benefit."
