    "comment": "I vote YES on the Ledger App Rewrite Treasury Withdrawal. \n\nThis proposal tackles a longstanding usability and testing challenge in the Cardano Ledger App by redesigning the UI to conform with embedded app standards, improving user experience and maintainability. Vacuumlabs brings proven expertise within the Cardano ecosystem, demonstrated through their prior work on wallets and DEX platforms. The proposal outlines clear off-chain contract management with milestone-based deliverables, supported by third-party auditing and transparent on-chain budget tracking via treasury smart contracts. At â‚³300,000, the funding is prudent and aligned with the scope, ensuring a vital infrastructure upgrade benefiting many Cardano users. Supporting this proposal advances ecosystem sustainability and developer tooling excellence."
