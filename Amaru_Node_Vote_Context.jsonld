Imagine, a smart fridge having the ability to run a node and generate income, used to pay for its own groceries, that are automatically reordered as needed, through both a blockchain enabled farmer-direct ordering app and delivery service. That would be something to see.\n\nIt is on this basis that I have voted YES to this proposal."
