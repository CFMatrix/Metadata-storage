    "comment": "I voted YES on the Treasury Withdrawal titled Blockfrost Platform Community Budget Proposal (₳1,300,000) based on its strong support during the Ekklesia budget phase (3.18B ADA voting in favor) and full compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution.\n\nThis proposal supports the Icebreakers Era, an evolution of the Blockfrost API from centralized backend to an open-source, SPO-powered infrastructure layer. By allowing trusted community node operators to run profitable Blockfrost endpoints and route traffic via the Gateway system, the platform decentralizes API access and empowers SPOs directly.\n\nThe technical controls around funding meet or exceed expectations:\n\nFunds administers via audited smart contracts (Sundae Labs)\n\nFund flows executed only after legal contracts + milestone approval\n\nProtected by a multisig oversight committee, and non-staking \"auto-abstain\" modeling\n\nStrategic benefits of this funding include enhanced access for dApp and mobile developers, enterprise-level private deployment (Solitary mode), and ADA-based micro-payment APIs using Hydra settlement channels.\n\nThe ₳1.3M budget is proportionate and compares favorably with infrastructure proposals of similar scope. All code will be open-sourced, ensuring zero vendor lock-in. I recommend approval of this proposal to ensure robust, sovereign API access for Cardano while supporting SPO viability and decentralization goals."
