    "comment": "I vote YES for the ₳212,000 treasury withdrawal to fund AdaStat.net, a proven, independently maintained, and open-access Cardano blockchain explorer.\n\nAdaStat offers vital real-time access to chain data, governance activities, stake pool performance, REST API integration, and a mobile-ready, fast UX/UI—all provided continuously for over five years.\n\nMaintaining a diverse set of independently operated explorers is crucial to preserving Cardano’s decentralization, transparency, and network resilience. AdaStat’s focus on open standards, governance data, and broad community utility (SPOs, DReps, CC, developers, and end users) aligns directly with Cardano’s core values.\n\nThe budget is reasonable for 24 months of technical development, performance upgrades, and operational support, representing high value for sustaining ecosystem-critical infrastructure. Project delivery and risk are well managed via a milestone-based legal contract, treasury multisig, Oversight Committee, and 3rd-party assurance.\n\nAdaStat’s independent operation helps mitigate single-point-of-failure risk, broadens community tooling, and increases accessibility of Cardano’s data to the global community, underpinning growth and adoption."
