    "comment": "I recommend voting NO on this ₳6,000,000 treasury withdrawal for the unified global events marketing strategy. While a coordinated global marketing approach to Cardano events is conceptually valuable, this proposal does not provide sufficient detail or justification to warrant funding at this scale.\n\nThe proposal lacks a granular marketing strategy with well-defined, measurable outcomes directly tied to ecosystem growth metrics. The budget is significant and not adequately broken down or clearly linked to demonstrable return on investment. The complexity of unifying multiple event marketing efforts requires strong coordination mechanisms and community buy-in, which the proposal does not sufficiently demonstrate.\n\nFurthermore, transparency around community involvement and feedback in crafting and executing the strategy is limited. Without clear public involvement or structured co-creation, there is risk that the strategy may not align well with the diverse needs of Cardano’s decentralized ecosystem.\n\nWhile the governance framework and treasury management are robust, these do not compensate for the strategic and operational uncertainties present.\n\nA more detailed, community-driven, and outcome-focused marketing proposal with clear KPIs and modest budget ask would be needed before treasury funding can be recommended."
