    "comment": "After careful review of the proposal requesting ₳4,000,000 ADA for expanding stablecoin and Cardano native asset support, I have decided to vote NO due to multiple fundamental concerns around clarity, accountability, and overall value for the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nKey Concerns:\n\nLack of Clear Scope and Deliverables\nThe proposal’s problem statement accurately identifies real challenges in stablecoin infrastructure, wallet and custodian support, exchange liquidity, and fiat ramps, which are critical for Cardano’s broader adoption and DeFi growth. However, the proposal itself is vague about what exactly will be built or improved. There is no clear, detailed roadmap or description of the technical solutions, no specific milestones, and no defined metrics for success. It reads more like high-level aspirations than a concrete development plan.\n\nUnclear Accountability and Governance\nIt is not clearly stated who the primary developers are or the structure of the team executing this work. The contractual relationship with the treasury is nebulous, leaving open questions about intellectual property rights, ownership of outputs, maintenance responsibilities, and ongoing support. There is no clear indication if this is a grant, a service contract, or another form of funding. Without defined governance or stewardship, it is difficult to evaluate how the community’s investment will be managed or safeguarded over time.\n\nAmbiguous ROI and Value to the Ecosystem\nGiven the significant treasury allocation requested (₳4 million), the proposal lacks convincing justification on return on investment (ROI) for the Cardano ecosystem. There is no roadmap on sustaining or scaling the work post-initial spend or how it enhances decentralization, public good infrastructure, or developer/community engagement. The benefits appear uncertain and unspecific, undermining confidence in the effective use of treasury funds.\n\nPotential Conflict of Interest and Limited Ecosystem Benefits\nThe proposal seems aimed primarily at supporting a single company’s stablecoin project (USDA and its infrastructure). Treasury funds should preferentially support open, public-good infrastructure benefitting the entire Cardano ecosystem, rather than subsidizing individual commercial interests. The proposal does not clarify how it ensures open access, interoperability, or contributions back to the ecosystem beyond the funded entity.\n\nCommunity and Governance Alignment\nThe proposal lacks a defined framework for community involvement, decentralization of control, or mechanisms for transparent reporting and accountability. This is misaligned with Cardano’s governance principles emphasizing inclusive, open, and community-driven development.\n\nAlternative Funding Sources and Risk Mitigation\nStablecoin infrastructure projects, especially those of a commercial nature, should ideally attract private sector investment or revenue-driven funding. The high-risk profile and commercial orientation of this proposal make it more appropriate for venture capital or token sale funding rather than community treasury support. Without mechanisms for value recycling or return to the treasury, it risks weakening long-term ecosystem financial sustainability.\n\nSummary:\nWhile the overarching problems this proposal seeks to address are legitimate and important for Cardano’s growth, the proposal’s lack of specificity, unclear accountability, possible commercial conflicts of interest, and poor governance alignment compel me to vote NO. I recommend resubmission with detailed technical scope, clear governance and IP frameworks, transparent budgets with defined milestones, and stronger demonstration of public-good benefits and ecosystem ROI. This will enable informed, confident community support aligned with Cardano’s decentralized vision and responsible treasury stewardship."
