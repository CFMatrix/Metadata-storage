  "body": {
    "comment": "This proposal is substantially the same as 'Withdraw ₳5M for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek' aside from the title and what appears to be an error or placeholder in the amount metadata (₳5 vs ₳5M). These 2 proposals appear to be duplicates or near-duplicates submitted twice—potentially one draft and one finalized, or a re-submission due to a metadata error.\n\nDespite the slight differences, the underlying issues remain the same and as such I'll use the same rationale as I did in the other proposal.\n\n\nAfter careful review, I am unable to support this proposal in its current form due to multiple critical constitutional and operational shortcomings relating to Cardano’s governance standards for treasury disbursement.\n\nKey issues necessitating a NO vote:\n\nConstitutional Noncompliance\n\nNo Named Administrator: The proposal does not specify an Administrator (such as Intersect or Cardano Development Holdings) responsible for the contractual, fiduciary, and oversight duties associated with Cardano Treasury withdrawals, as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution.\n\nNo Legal Contract Commitment: There is no explicit commitment to a legal, off-chain contract with defined milestones, deliverables, dispute resolution, and reporting. This is mandatory for all treasury withdrawals to ensure enforceability and accountability.\n\nLack of Milestone-Based Escrow: The proposal does not establish milestone-based, smart contract–gated disbursement. Funds appear poised for full or discretionary release, with no clear controls to ensure payment only upon delivery of new exchange listings or defined KPIs.\n\nLack of Third-Party Assurance and Oversight: The proposal leaves out provisions for an independent oversight agent—such as Cardano Foundation, DQuadrant, or NMKR—to serve as milestone verifier and ensure funds are released only when contractual obligations are met.\n\nOperational Risks\n\nNo Smart Contract Controls or Delegation Policy: There is no commitment to use the Sundae Labs Treasury Reserve Smart Contracts (TRSC/PSSC) or multi-signature custodial controls; nor is there any assurance that funds will be delegated only to an auto-abstain DRep (not to a Stake Pool Operator), violating best practices in treasury security.\n\nNo Process for Vendor KYB/KYC: The proposal does not affirm that the Snek Foundation (or principals) will provide pre-funding verification, Know-Your-Business (KYB) or Know-Your-Customer (KYC) documentation.\n\nNo Refund/Clawback or Unused Funds Handling: While there is mention of returning unused budget, there is no contractual guarantee, escrow mechanism, or refund process described for unsupported, failed, or incomplete listings.\n\nTransparency and Overlap\n\nRisk of Duplication: The proposal does not clarify coordination or non-overlap with existing, already-funded Cardano exchange listing and market-making pools (e.g., Flowdesk). There is risk of duplicated listing efforts or double fee payments.\n\nInadequate Public and On-Chain Reporting Commitments: While intent for transparency is stated, there is no binding provision for on-chain metadata, announcement of exchange targets, or progress tracking following the established Cardano treasury reporting practice.\n\nIn summary:\nWhile the proposal is high-impact and the vendor has strong credentials, Cardano’s constitutional governance exists to prevent treasury capture and enforce stewardship. Treasury funds must be administered only under named, contractually bound, multi-party and externally assured processes. In the absence of these basic protections, a YES vote would undermine decentralization, transparency, and accountability for the entire ecosystem.\n\nI am therefore compelled to vote NO until these core operational and constitutional deficiencies are remedied."
