    "comment": "I am voting YES on this proposal to fund Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions with ₳889,500.\n\nThis initiative addresses a critical need to make Cardano projects more visible and accessible at influential exhibitions globally. By subsidizing (not fully covering) project participation, the proposal enables diverse Cardano teams to showcase their work, attract investors and developers, and educate new audiences about the ecosystem’s depth and innovation. Importantly, the approach includes education and follow-up support to maximize each project's event return, and employs a milestone model to ensure accountability and efficiency with treasury funds.\n\nVendor experience, transparent milestone-based process, and scaled-back budget further enhance cost-effectiveness and trust. This is a practical, high-ROI initiative that strengthens Cardano's global presence and supports sustainable ecosystem growth.\n\nFor these reasons, I support this funding request."
