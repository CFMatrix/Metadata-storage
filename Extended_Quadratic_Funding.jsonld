    "comment": "This proposal is an important evolutionary complement to Project Catalyst, introducing a forward-thinking funding mechanism centered on extended quadratic funding, reputation-weighted voting, and transparent milestone accountability. It not only addresses existing Catalyst challenges such as concentrated voting power, protracted or uncertain milestone execution, and lack of visibility into project impact, but also pioneers new methods for community-driven, scalable innovation funding.\n\nCrucially, the proposal recognizes that responsible ecosystem growth depends on robust research and iterative prototyping. Only by actively exploring alternative models and questioning established assumptions can Cardano continue to refine its governance and funding processes. This initiative supports exactly that by creating space to evaluate new options, better understand the types of problems we face, and uncover which questions we ought to be asking as the treasury evolves.\n\nThe team behind this proposal brings extensive experience from leading innovation platforms and blockchain development, reinforcing confidence in successful delivery. Financial oversight is strengthened through audited Sundae Labs smart contracts and multi-party governance, ensuring treasury security and accountability. All allocated funds flow directly to projects, maximizing real-world impact and eliminating operational overhead.\n\nMandatory standardized impact reporting sets a clear benchmark for transparency, enabling systematic learning from outcomes and making it possible to continuously fine-tune funding mechanisms based on real data.\n\nMost importantly, the proposal encourages broader participation—from individual donors to major stakeholders—and invites the ecosystem to take shared ownership of its own evolution. By prototyping new models and gathering actionable insights, it ensures Cardano’s innovation funding toolkit can adapt and improve over time.\n\nFor these reasons, I recommend supporting this proposal as a critical step toward a more flexible, research-led, and collaborative approach to decentralized treasury management on Cardano—one that remains accountable, transparent, and open to continuous improvement.\n"
