    "comment": "Given the current state of the Cardano ecosystem, I believe the proposed NCL amount is a far more practical option compared to previous iterations presented thus far.\n\nWhile a 200M NCL leaves little room for anything beyond core research, development, and operations in 2025, I am convinced this focus is precisely where our attention should be in the short to medium term.\n\nAs a community now fully responsible for the direction, scale, and pace of the ecosystemâ€™s expansion and evolution, we must ensure a robust and comprehensive framework of policies, procedures, infrastructure, and auditing is in place before allocating significant resources to areas we are currently unprepared or unable to support.\n\nThis approach should be a priority across all areas of the ecosystem but is particularly critical for administration, governance, and funding, which currently lack substance, quality, and transparency."
