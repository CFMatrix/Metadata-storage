    "comment": "I vote YES on the treasury withdrawal proposal for â‚³583,000 to maintain and sustain Eternl, a core user wallet infrastructure for Cardano. \n\nEternl has demonstrated consistent operational and technical capability since 2021, supporting a wide range of users across platforms.\n\nThe proposal seeks operational funding necessary to cover mature, steady-state maintenance costs, critical for ensuring ongoing security, reliability, and compatibility within the Cardano ecosystem. Maintaining a high-quality wallet infrastructure facilitates user retention, network participation, and developer integration, which are vital for long-term ecosystem health.\n\nThe governance framework ensures accountability and transparency via a legally binding contract with clear milestones, third-party milestone assurance, and audited on-chain treasury tooling managed under a multisig and Oversight Committee to reduce risks of fund mismanagement.\n\nThe requested budget is consistent with industry norms for sustained maintenance of essential software services. Approval will preserve a key gateway for Cardano's users and developers, supporting continued platform growth and adoption."
