    "comment": "After a thorough review of the Input Output Research (IOR) Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025 proposal and all supporting documentation, I am voting YES for the following key reasons:\n\nAlignment with Cardano’s Strategic Roadmap and Vision\nThe proposal directly supports multiple priority areas in the 2025 Cardano Product Roadmap, including Developer/User Experience, Scaling the Layer 1 Engine, Architectural Excellence, Leios, Layer 2 Expansion, SPO Incentive Improvements, Multiple Node Implementations, Incoming Liquidity, and Programmable Assets.\nThe multi-year Cardano Vision research agenda underpins foundational scientific breakthroughs essential to Cardano’s sustained leadership in blockchain innovation, ensuring the ecosystem’s competitiveness and resilience for years to come.\n\nComprehensive, Evidence-Based Research Program\nIOR proposes a rigorous, systematic research funnel delivering over 20 peer-reviewed academic papers annually, along with prioritized, technology-validated development streams. This methodical approach balances fundamental blockchain science with real-world technical validation, advancing both theory and practice, a critical capability unique and indispensable for Cardano’s ecosystem.\n\nExperienced and Credible Team\nInput Output Research has demonstrated extensive prior success with a track record of over 200 published academic papers and pivotal contributions to Cardano’s architecture and protocol innovations (e.g., Ouroboros consensus, Hydra, Mithril). The team includes multidisciplinary experts in distributed systems, cryptography, game theory, and formal methods, instilling confidence in delivery and quality.\n\nTransparent Budget and Resource Allocation\nThe requested funding of approximately ₳26.8 million (USD $13.42M equivalent) covers 56 full-time equivalents spanning research, technology validation, administration, dissemination, and stakeholder engagement. This seems reasonable and proportional for the scope and impact of work outlined, especially given the high cost and complexity of blockchain R&D.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Dissemination\nIOR commits to robust communication and knowledge sharing with the broader Cardano ecosystem, including SPOs, developers, DReps, and committees. They aim to operationalize open frameworks for academic visibility, collaborative cross-team research, and public availability of insights and artifacts, thus maximizing ecosystem benefit.\n\nGovernance and Oversight\nThe proposal is under the appropriate oversight mechanisms, with designated administration and contractual safeguards aligned with Cardano treasury governance expectations, ensuring a structured, accountable execution process.\n\nRisks Well-Considered and Mitigated\nDependencies between research streams and technology validation projects are acknowledged and managed within the proposal, reducing risk of bottlenecks. The focus on multi-year sustained funding further mitigates resource continuity risk which is essential in complex academic research cycles.\n\nSummary:\nInput Output Research’s Cardano Vision program for 2025 is a vital, strategic investment in Cardano’s long-term technical foundation and market leadership. By advancing cutting-edge scalable consensus protocols, novel cryptographic constructs, governance innovations, and interoperability research, it ensures that Cardano stays at the forefront of blockchain technology evolution. The proposal is well-aligned with community priorities, fiscally sensible, and backed by a proven team committed to rigorous academic standards and ecosystem transparency. I support its funding to maintain Cardano’s path of unparalleled research-driven progress."
