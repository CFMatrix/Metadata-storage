    "comment": "I recommend voting YES on this proposal to fund the Cardano Builder DAO administered by Intersect with ₳12,000,000. This funding addresses a crucial gap in the Cardano ecosystem by providing dedicated, sustainable financial backing and strategic support specifically for live, user-facing dApps driving meaningful on-chain activity, TVL, and ecosystem engagement.\n\nThe project leverages proven governance infrastructure built on Clarity and Agora smart contracts, enabling transparent, member-driven decision-making and treasury management. The DAO structure complements Project Catalyst by focusing on the scale-up phase of projects rather than early-stage startup innovation, thereby ensuring both innovation and growth receive targeted support.\n\nRobust treasury administration, including multi-party authorization and independent oversight, provides confidence in governance and fund security. Planned KPIs and milestone monitoring will permit clear tracking of projects’ impact and ROI.\n\nSupporting application-layer projects is vital to growing Cardano’s user base, increasing real usage metrics, and driving the ecosystem towards mass adoption. This DAO proposes a scalable, community-aligned funding model essential for long-term ecosystem health and resilience."
