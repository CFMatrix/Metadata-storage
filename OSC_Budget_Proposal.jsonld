    "comment": "I vote YES on the OSC Budget Proposal – Paid Open Source Model treasury withdrawal. \n\nCardano’s open-source ecosystem is fundamental to the security, reliability, and continued innovation of the network. This proposal implements a structured funding model that directly targets longstanding needs for maintainability, bug bounty funding, onboarding new contributors, incident response, and sustained development of foundational code, tools, and documentation across the ecosystem. The outlined programs – including a Maintainer Retainer, developer onboarding tracks, and security initiatives – are broad in scope and essential for ecosystem health. The funding mechanism is staged, uses milestone-based contracts, and is subject to community monitoring and external third-party oversight. All treasury operations tied to this proposal are transparently managed on-chain with public compliance to Cardano governance requirements. The total requested amount is commensurate with the scope and the historical scale of under-resourcing for critical open source in Cardano. \n\nApproval of this treasury withdrawal supports a predictable and transparent approach to building a sustainable open-source foundation for Cardano."
