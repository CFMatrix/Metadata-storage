    "comment": "I am now voting YES on this proposal after further direct engagement with the proposer and gaining additional context that meaningfully changes my assessment.\n\n1. Direct communication to address concerns — The proposer reached out to me personally to clarify the intent, constraints, and future vision for NFTCDN. This responsiveness, determination, and willingness to address questions directly has increased my confidence in their commitment to delivering genuine value to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n2. Context of the first-ever voting round — Given that this is our first treasury voting cycle and the submission process was flawed (no definitive guidelines, inconsistent formatting, no pre-vote vetting, and incomplete info capture), I believe significant leeway is warranted when evaluating initial proposals. Early votes are as much about establishing process and gathering operational data as they are about perfecting proposals.\n\n3. Existing gap in operational data and reporting — The Cardano ecosystem currently lacks consolidated operational usage metrics, cost baselines, and infrastructure demand data that would allow for accurate long-term planning. This proposal can help fill that gap by capturing concrete adoption and performance data from real-world usage.\n\n4. Lowering barriers for developer experimentation — One of the largest constraints to grassroots and professional developer growth is the cost/time required to produce a working Proof of Concept or prototype. NFTCDN’s free-tier access for 18 months could meaningfully reduce these barriers, enabling more developers to bring long-imagined projects to life and test market viability without the upfront infrastructure burden.\n\n5. Reframing as R&D and ecosystem requirements gathering — Initially, I saw this as a private SaaS expansion play. After discussion with the proposer, I now see it as a development research and requirement validation initiative, where the output includes usage metrics, demand analysis, and integration feedback that can inform future infrastructure planning. This shift in perspective addresses my original concerns about vendor lock-in and sustainability.\n\n6. Appropriateness of scope and cost — The budget request aligns with the scope of work and anticipated outputs. If the initiative delivers the expected adoption data, operational performance reports, and developer integration insights at this price point, it will represent good value for the treasury as an R&D investment.\n\nFor these reasons, I now support this proposal as a strategically relevant initiative to gather critical ecosystem data, lower developer onboarding costs, and inform future infrastructure funding decisions. While I still expect that future proposals evolve toward open-source, distributed governance models, the unique context of this first cycle and the concrete commitments from the proposer make this a worthwhile and timely investment.\n\n~~~~\n\nFor additional context and future reference I am leaving my original No vote rationale below as I am not entirely sure how the voting data and rationale relationships are maintained and would hate for any potentially relevant information to get lost.\n\nOriginal No vote:\n\nI am voting NO on this proposal, as it does not meet the standards for open, sustainable, and community-owned infrastructure that Cardano’s treasury should prioritize.\n\nWhile content delivery for native asset metadata and media is a legitimate need, this solution is centralized, proprietary, and insufficiently transparent regarding both budget and long-term sustainability. Funding a single vendor to provide a non-critical CDN on a closed-source, commercial basis risks lock-in, undermines decentralization, and sets a precedent for treasury-funded private SaaS subsidies.\n\nThe proposal’s claimed cost savings and ROI are not supported by detailed technical or financial disclosures, and the reliance on a free period followed by uncertain pricing leaves projects exposed if future funding is denied or terms change. Additionally, current ecosystem adoption is limited, and similar functionality can be achieved with more open and competitively priced alternatives.\n\nI encourage resubmission of a leaner, open-source, and community-governed proposal, developed transparently and collaboratively, before treasury support is reconsidered."
