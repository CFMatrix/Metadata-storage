    "comment": "I vote YES to the treasury withdrawal proposal for ₳657,692 in support of the Scalus DApps Development Platform. \n\nThis platform aims to streamline and unify the Cardano smart contract and DApp development experience through Scala 3, offering a consistent tooling ecosystem that covers the full development lifecycle—from setup to deployment.\n\nGiven the steep learning curve and fragmented toolsets currently discouraging developer onboarding, Scalus addresses a significant bottleneck by bridging traditional Scala/Java/Kotlin developer expertise with the Cardano ecosystem’s needs. Such unification has the potential to reduce time-to-market, improve code safety, and tap into a wider talent pool — all critical factors for Cardano's scaling and enterprise adoption goals.\n\nThe vendor brings relevant domain expertise as a former IOG engineer familiar with Cardano’s FP and blockchain ecosystem, enhancing confidence in delivery. The proposal includes a well-defined contractual plan with milestones, third-party milestone acceptance, and robust governance and treasury oversight, ensuring risk is managed and accountability ensured.\n\nThe budget aligns reasonably with the scope of work for betting on a scalable development platform aimed at improving ecosystem inclusivity and productivity. Transparency measures and governance compliance are fully in place.\n\nApproval will support expanding Cardano’s developer base through a production-ready, unified development platform designed for professional and business teams, thus fostering innovation and adoption."
