    "comment": "I vote YES on the Maestro Treasury Withdrawal proposal to fund the development of a comprehensive Web3 developer stack dedicated to positioning Cardano as the smart contract and DeFi layer for Bitcoin. \n\nThis strategic project addresses a critical ecosystem need by enabling Cardano to tap into Bitcoin’s considerable liquidity and user base through robust infrastructure including blockchain indexing, mempool monitoring, event notifications, and wallet management. Maestro demonstrates strong capability with an established track record delivering infrastructure for key Cardano projects and integrations. The proposal includes clear legal contract frameworks with milestone-based deliverables, backed by 3rd party assurance, governed transparently via treasury management smart contracts. \n\nThe requested ₳600,000 budget is well justified relative to the project's scope and impact, employing rigorous audit and oversight processes. \n\nSupporting Maestro will substantially enhance Cardano’s smart contract ecosystem, developer experience, and overall ecosystem growth."
