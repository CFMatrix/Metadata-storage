    "comment": "I voted YES on the Treasury Withdrawal titled \"MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix\" (₳45,217) after reviewing all submitted materials.\n\nThe Administrator is clearly named and this proposal is governed by a milestone-based off-chain contract with Cardano Development Holdings, including independent milestone review, 3rd-party assurance, and transparent delivery schedules. Disbursements are executed through a thoroughly audited smart contract system that prevents unilateral control and ensures community oversight.\n\nThe proposal itself delivers critical maintenance for the Cardano.nix deployment framework, a widely-used open-source tool for reproducible infrastructure builds across the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano.nix underpins deployment pipelines used by both community and IOG/Daedalus node operators, and this funding ensures consistent upgrades, bug fixes, and developer experience improvements.\n\nMLabs is an experienced and trusted vendor with a proven track record. The requested amount is proportional to the scope and essential to maintaining infrastructure readiness in Cardano’s growth and governance phase.\n\nFor these reasons, I support this Treasury Withdrawal and recommend affirmative votes from all DReps committed to Cardano’s stability, open tooling, and infrastructure maturity."
